# Outer Space Attackers! (aka: Space Invaders Replica)

Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. It was manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and licensed by the Midway division of Bally for overseas distribution. Within the shooter game genre, Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible.

Designer Nishikado drew inspiration from Breakout (1976), Gun Fight (1975), target shooting games, and science fiction narratives such as The War of the Worlds, Space Battleship Yamato and Star Wars. To complete development of the game, he had to design custom hardware and development tools. Upon release, Space Invaders was an immediate commercial success; by 1982, it had grossed $3.8 billion (equivalent to over $13 billion adjusted for inflation as of 2016), with a net profit of $450 million. This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing "entertainment product" at the time, and the highest-grossing video game of all time.

Space Invaders is considered one of the most influential video games of all time. It helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry, and ushered in the golden age of arcade video games. It was the inspiration for numerous video games and game designers across different genres, and has been ported and re-released in various forms. The 1980 Atari VCS version quadrupled sales of the VCS, thereby becoming the first killer app for video game consoles. More broadly, the pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often representing video games as a whole.

# Current features
This version is a "single level" game, meaning that when you destroy all enemy ships or die in a firery explosion, it's over.

As in the original game, when you kill an enemy, the remaining ones will speed up a bit (and will also be worth more points).

Tip: the enemies will always fly to the edge of the screen, so if focus in killing the enemies at the edges, you'll have more room to breath.

# TODO
1. Add start menu
2. Add multiple levels
3. Refactor GameController into smaller components
